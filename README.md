This repository contains the primary Python functions used in my fMRI data analysis pipeline, as described in the Methods/2.4.2 Data Analysis section of my masterâ€™s thesis. The code was automatically commented and translated into English by GPT-4 to improve clarity and readability. Additionally, the repository includes the penultimate version of the localizer script used to identify language-related regions in the fMRI data.
